This is a LOLCODE interpreter I wrote as a project for my Computer Programming class. Don't expect anything spectacular - I only wrote this to get a passing mark, plus I'm a C/C++ programmer (can probably tell by typedefs.pas) and feel very awkward with Pascal.

I hereby declare this source code as licensed under the WTFPL (i.e. do whatever the fuck you want with it, as long as you don't state you wrote it).

For questions etc. feel free to e-mail me.
